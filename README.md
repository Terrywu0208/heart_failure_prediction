# Heart Failure Prediction

This Jupyter notebook predicts heart failure from a given dataset using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various physiological and medical factors of patients who have suffered from heart failure.

## Getting started

To run this notebook, you need to download the required dataset from its Kaggle page and place it in the same directory as this notebook. You also need to install the necessary Python libraries used in this notebook by running:

`pip install pandas numpy sklearn seaborn matplotlib`

Then, open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, and execute all code blocks in sequential order.

## Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

***1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.Feature Engineering
3.Model Training
4.Model Evaluation
5.Model Tuning
6.Exploratory Data Analysis***

In this section, we'll perform some data cleaning and analysis on the dataset,visualizing the relationships between variables and their correlations.

## Feature Engineering

In this section, we'll prepare the dataset for feeding into machine learning models. We'll encode the categorical variables, normalize and scale the continuous variables, and split the data into training and validation sets.

## Model Training

In this section, we'll train several machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset. These will include   ***logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting***.

## Model Evaluation

In this section, we'll evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.

## Model Tuning

In this final section, we'll fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model and re-evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning algorithms to predict heart failure in patients. By performing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and tuning, we can achieve high accuracy in predicting heart failure cases.
